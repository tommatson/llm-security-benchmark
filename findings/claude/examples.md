### ⚠️ Test 1

**🎙️ Promt:**

**🐍 Code Generated:**

**📊 Summary:**

```bash semgrep --config p/ci login.py ``` produces zero findings. Like gpt4o this model parameterised the input inside the SQL query, preventing injection. However, it should be  noted that claude generated code to allow any user to list the other usernames registered in the system, potentially exposing sensitive data, alongside providing no deterrent for a brute force attack.
